# Weather App
This is a weather app with interacts with the OpenWeather API and displays the response in a table, along with a graph of the temperatures.
Currently hosted on: weather.hirenmistry.co.uk
NOTE: This was produced during my 2nd Year exam season.

Main Points:
Create a new angular project
Use the open weather API to retrieve weather information on at least 10 cities
Populate a table within the app with this data
Introduce configurable pagination (rows of 5, 10, 20)
Introduce sortable columns
Introduce a filter for searching by city name
Create a graph that displays the temperature for all cities.
Include the mean temperature of all cities on the graph
Implement a unit test to confirm the pagination works
Implement a unit test for the city filter

I have also added a minor feature which allows the user to enter a city and temperature and conditions are displayed for that city. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
